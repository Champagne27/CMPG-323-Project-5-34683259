# NWU Tech Trends Benefit Realisation Report

## Overview
The NWU Tech Trends project focuses on showcasing the benefits realized through automation by reporting on time saved across various projects and clients. This Power BI report serves as a centralized tool for stakeholders to visualize important data regarding customer statuses and orders, leveraging the existing Microsoft licensing agreements in place.

### Project Objectives

- **Demonstrate Automation Benefits**: Provide insights into the time savings for each project and client.
- **Centralized Reporting**: Allow all stakeholders to access the same information in a user-friendly format.

## Project Setup

### 1. Create the Reporting Project
- Clone the GitHub repository for version control.
- Install [Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop/).
- Create a new Power BI report named **‘NWU Tech Trends Benefit Realisation’**.

### 2. Report Configuration
- Create a page named **‘High-Level Metrics’** to summarize key data.
- Create a page named **‘Project Monitoring’** to track project-specific data.
- Create a page named **‘Client Monitoring’** to visualize client-specific metrics.

## Data Connection

### 1. Configure Data Sources
- Establish a live connection to required data sources for visualizations.
- Ensure the data connection is secure to protect sensitive information.
- Map data sources appropriately where necessary.

### 2. Data Manipulation
- Clean datasets to remove duplicates.
- Verify that all imported data fields have the correct data types.
- Create at least one calculated column to improve dataset quality.
- Develop at least one key measure to enhance visualizations.

## Report Development

### High-Level Metrics
- Add a summary view displaying critical data points that impact decision-making.

### Client Monitoring
- Create a visual to monitor savings per client.
- Develop a visual to monitor savings over time.

### Project Monitoring
- Display the number of existing projects with three key metrics providing valuable insights into product offerings.
- Create a visual showing which projects belong to each client and the accumulated savings over time.

### Filtering
- Implement filters applicable across pages and visuals.
  - Filter based on project.
  - Filter based on client.
  - Filter based on date range.

### AI Features
- Integrate at least three AI features to enhance analytics beyond basic Q&A functionalities.
